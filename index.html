  <h2>
    A brief history of Tables.
  </h2>
  <p4>
    TABLE, basic article of furniture, known and used in the Western world since at least the 7th century bce, consisting of a flat slab of stone, metal, wood, or glass supported by trestles, legs, or a pillar. Egyptian tables were made of wood, Assyrian of metal, and Grecian usually of bronze.
    The oldest wooden or stone tables are thought to have originated in ancient Egypt. Tables evolved over time and were frequently utilised as status symbols by the wealthy. Tables from the Renaissance era were frequently adorned with complex carvings and inlaid with priceless materials like mother-of-pearl and ivory.

  <h3>
    Compositions of tables.
  </h3>
  
  <p5>
    Many tables are made of wood or wood-based products; some are made of other materials including metal and glass. Most tables are composed of a flat surface and one or more supports (legs). A table with a single, central foot is a pedestal table. Long tables often have extra legs for support.

    What kind of table goes well with your House?
  </h5>
  <p7>
    Coffe tables are those pieces of furniture that are usually located in front of the sofa and serve to create a sense of warmth and comfort that characterizes any living room. A coffee table, true to its name, serves to rest small objects, like cups of coffee or tea, and have them readily available when on the couch. The perfect height for a coffee table ranges from 30 to 45 cm, and a coffee table should never be higher than your sofa.
    
  </p7>
  <p8>
    Console tables are especially functional pieces of furniture as they are often used in the entryway or next to the front door and are the perfect space to store keys and other trinkets. Often they’re combined with a mirror so you can check your appearance before heading out the door. A console’s standard dimensions are 35-40 cm, with heights varying from 60 to 70 cm.

 Coffee-Table-INFINITY-by-Claesson-Koivisto-Rune-for-Arflex-01

This guide will take you through the many types of various tables out there so that you can choose just the right one for your home, office or venue. The first important step is to always check how much space you have before purchasing any table, as well as decide the purpose your table will have.

Designer coffee tables and side tables
 

Glass Coffee Table INFINITY by Claesson Koivisto Rune for Arflex
 

Coffee tables are those pieces of furniture that are usually located in front of the sofa and serve to create a sense of warmth and comfort that characterizes any living room. A coffee table, true to its name, serves to rest small objects, like cups of coffee or tea, and have them readily available when on the couch. The perfect height for a coffee table ranges from 30 to 45 cm, and a coffee table should never be higher than your sofa.

 

Accent Table CICOGNINO by Franco Albini for Cassina

Conversely, side or accent tables normally range from 50 to 70 cm in height and are more decorative design pieces. In fact, side tables aren’t arranged in the center of the room or in front of the couch, but rather to the sides of the sofa or window.
 

Side Table TOD by Todd Bracher for Zanotta

C-shaped tables are sophisticated accent tables, like the TOD coffee table designed by Todd Bracher for Zanotta. This type of table has a distinctive shape and offers convenience and functionality as it can be moved closer to the couch or slide under it, as well as offers the perfect spot for working or eating.

 

Square Table Set CORDULA CUOIO by Missoni Home Collection

For those in need of flexible, versatile furnishings, stackable coffee tables are the ideal solution. Go for groups of two or more small tables or nesting tables in differing sizes, like Missoni Home Collection’s CORDULA CUOIO tables.

Console tables are especially functional pieces of furniture as they are often used in the entryway or next to the front door and are the perfect space to store keys and other trinkets. Often they’re combined with a mirror so you can check your appearance before heading out the door. A console’s standard dimensions are 35-40 cm, with heights varying from 60 to 70 cm.

Designer dining tables
 

Dining Table ASYMMETRIC by DFdesignLab
 

Your dining table is that essential piece of furniture that often defines the layout of a home. There are nearly endless types of dining tables, and it can be challenging to choose just the right one for you and your space. Rectangular dining tables are the most classic, but if you want to save space, a round table can be a better fit. Instead, oval tables can tend to offer a more impactful and harmonious look.

Whether or not you choose a dining table that can be extended with leaves, keep in mind how many people can sit at your table. When seated, a person needs 40 cm in front of them to eat comfortably, while each diner’s seat needs at least 60 cm of space so as to move around with ease.

Rectangular table measurements:
Four-seater: 100 cm x 80 cm
Six-seater: 120 cm x 80 cm
Eight-seater: 180 cm x 80 cm
Ten-seater: 240 cm x 80 cm

Round table measurements:
Four-seater: at least 77 cm in diameter
Six-seater: at least 115 cm in diameter
Eight-seater: at least 153 cm in diameter
Twelve-seater: at least 230 cm in diameter

Oval table measurements:
Four-seater: 120 cm x 60 cm
Six-seater: 180 cm x 90 cm
Eight-seater 100 cm x 200 cm
Ten-seater: 240 cm x 120 cm
